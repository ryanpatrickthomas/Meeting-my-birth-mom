<pre><code> On my birthday in May of 2015 I told myself that I was no longer interested in meeting my biological parents, in retrospect it is safe to say that I was bullsh*ting myself. 
</code></pre>

<p>The date is December 31st 2015, and I am a 29-year-old male going through an internal anxiety attack like nothing I have ever felt before.  I am trying my best to stop myself from shaking, and I feel like there is a good chance I am going to pass out, or possibly throw up.</p>

<pre><code> I had just walked in through a back door to a kitchen that was filled with at least 10 people who seemed to immediately stop talking upon my entrance.  To be honest I am fairly certain that I temporarily blacked out, but the next memory of that moment is of tears rolling down my eyes.  In one of the most surreal moments of my life I am standing in the middle of a kitchen surrounded by people, and every single one of them looks like me. Everyone took turns introducing themselves, but initially I did not remember a single one as every name that came through my ears forced my brain into a steady outburst of what seemed like endless tears of joy.  Walking into that door and seeing the face of my grandmother, and various aunts, uncles, and cousins is a moment that will forever live in my head.  This was already the best night of my life, and it was just beginning.

 I received my biological information from my mom about two months prior, and this started off the most important investigative search that I have ever attempted.  I only had the name of my biological mother, being in the technology age that name was more than sufficient to search.   A basic social media search went for not, as she did not have any type of social media presence, but after two days of almost two days of nonstop searching on the internet I struck gold on a random google image page that led me to the women’s basketball roster for division three college in Southern Illinois.  I found a set of twins who both had her listed in their player profile, and that name brought up their pictures from the roster.  I knew as soon as I saw their pictures that I had found my sisters because the resemblance was undeniable 
</code></pre>

<p>This turned into a much more successful social media search I found both of their profiles on “the book” and after virtual stalking through hundreds of pictures I came upon a picture of them with a good looking young brother who I knew had to be my brother based off those good looks (it’s the genes!).  An eventual message to him via twitter initiated an exchange of contact information and the most emotional 4 person call that I will ever have in my life.</p>

<pre><code> Flash forward to December 31st, 2015.  It is the birthday of the beautiful woman who brought me into this existence; her family is throwing her a surprise birthday party, and I am the extra surprise.  I am sitting on the couch of the Aunt who I just met for the first time, trying to let my emotions recover from the shock of meeting everyone, suddenly the lights turn off in preparation of her entrance.  After the initial surprise is exclaimed I can hear her voice talking and laughing as she makes her way through the crowd.  As soon as she made her way past the final person who stood in-between us, I stood we made eye contact, and all conversations stopped.  I may have managed so squeak out a “hello”, but other than that I don’t think a single word was said for a few minutes.  In reality, at that moment there were no words were needed, I was being embraced by my Mother, a younger brother, and what turned out to be 3 younger sisters; everything was alright with me.  For one of the first times in my life I did not feel alone.

 After the emotions wore off, the party started and it took all of about 10 seconds for me to fit right in.  I can sum this part of the up by saying that it was the party of the century; we not only missed breakfast at the hotel, but somehow managed to wake up over an hour past our checkout time. Both of my eyes looked like I had been punched in the face all night, but it was more than worth it.

 There is another chapter to this saga that involves my birth-father, but there is no happy ending and to keep things positive I am going to save that for another time because I am focused on my blessings. Everything that has happened in regards to my family has been a blessing, and it is getting bigger every day.
